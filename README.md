## Features
### Future Features
- Keep player's score
## Testing
The following are the manual tests i conducted on this project
- I checked the code using a PEP8 linter to make sure there are no issues
- Tested on the Code Institute Heroku terminal and my local terminal
### Bugs
### Remaining Bugs
- No longer any bugs
### Validator Testing
- PEP8
 - Returned from PEP8online.com without any issues
## Deployment
Code Institute's mock terminal for Heroku was used to deploy this app
- Deployment steps
 - Fork or Clone this repository
 - A new Heroku account
 - Python and NodeJS should be the buildbacks in that order
 - Connect the Heroku app to the Repository
 - Select "Deploy"
## Credits
